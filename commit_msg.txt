fix: explicit body_yaw calculation for collision prevention

Reference project analysis showed that set_automatic_body_yaw is NOT used.
Instead, body_yaw is explicitly calculated based on head yaw angle.

Changes:
- movement_manager.py: Calculate body_yaw in _compose_final_pose()
  - Body follows head when head yaw exceeds 25 degrees threshold
  - If head is at 40 degrees, body rotates to 15 degrees
- voice_assistant.py: Remove set_automatic_body_yaw(True) call
- Update all related comments to reflect new approach

This matches the reference project's GotoQueueMove pattern where
target_body_yaw is explicitly calculated and interpolated.
