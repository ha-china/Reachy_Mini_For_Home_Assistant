fix: simplify body_yaw to match reference project exactly

After thorough analysis of SDK and reference project:
- SDK default automatic_body_yaw=True handles collision prevention
- SDK's inverse_kinematics_safe auto-adjusts body_yaw (max 65° relative)
- Reference project's BreathingMove always returns body_yaw=0.0

Changed:
- movement_manager.py: Pass body_yaw=0.0, let SDK handle automatically
- Removed manual body_yaw calculation that may interfere with SDK
- Updated docstrings to explain SDK's automatic mechanism

This exactly matches how the reference project works:
1. Pass body_yaw=0.0 to set_target()
2. SDK's inverse_kinematics_safe auto-adjusts to prevent collision
